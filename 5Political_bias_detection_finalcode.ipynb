            "Article: YS Jagan and Sharmila: వైఎస్‌ జగన్, షర్మిల రూటే వేరు! కీలక సమయంలో కనిపించకపోవడంపై విమర్శలు YS Jagan and Sharmila: ఏపీలో రాజకీయాలు చాలా విచిత్రంగా నడుస్తున్నాయి. ఒకవైపు అధికారంలో ఉన్న కూటమి ప్రతిదాన్నీ వీలైనంత ఎక్కువ ప్రచారం చేస్తూ అనుక్షణం ప్రజల నాలుకలపై ఉండడానికి ప్రయత్నిస్తుంటే మరువైపు ప్రతిపక్ష పార్టీల అధినేతలు ఎక్కడో వెనకడుగు వేస్తున్నారు అనే అభిప్రాయం చాలా మందిలో ఉంది. దానికి తగ్గట్టే మాజీ ముఖ్యమంత్రి వైఎస్ జగన్ కీలక సమయాల్లో ఏపీలో ఉండటం లేదన్న అభిప్రాయం రాజకీయ వర్గాల్లో వ్యక్తం అవుతుంటే ఇప్పుడాయన చెల్లెలు, రాష్ట్ర కాంగ్రెస్ అధ్యక్షురాలు వైఎస్ షర్మిల కూడా అదే బాటలో ఉంటున్నారు. రాజకీయాల్లో ఇది సరైన స్ట్రాటజీ కాదని నిపుణులు అంటున్నారు.తాడేపల్లి కంటే బెంగుళూరులోనే అధికంగా ఉంటున్న YS జగన్2019 ఎన్నికలకు ముందు తాను \"అమరావతిలోనే సొంత ఇల్లు కట్టుకున్నానని చంద్రబాబు ఆ సాహసం చేయడం లేదని\" పదేపదే చెప్పుకున్న జగన్మోహన్ రెడ్డి 2024లో పార్టీ ఓడిపోయాక వీలైనంత ఎక్కువ సమయం బెంగుళూరులోనే ఉంటున్నారనే అభిప్రాయం సొంత పార్టీ నేతల నుంచే వ్యక్తం అవుతోంది. నేతలు ముఖ్యమైన విషయాలు ఆయనతో చర్చించాల్సిన అవసరం వచ్చినా లేక రాష్ట్రంలో ఏదైనా అవాంతరం వచ్చినా వెంటనే రియాక్ట్ అవ్వాల్సిన సమయాల్లో బెంగళూరులో ఉన్న జగన్మోహన్ రెడ్డి తాడేపల్లికి వచ్చే వరకు వాళ్లు వెయిట్ చేయాల్సి వస్తోంది. నిన్న మొన్నటి తుపాన్ సమయంలో కూడా అయన బెంగళూరులోనే ఉన్నారు. విజయవాడకు రావాల్సి ఉన్నా విమానాలు క్యాన్సిల్ కావడంతో ఆయన రాలేకపోయారు. దీన్ని ఆయన రాజకీయ ప్రత్యర్థులు విమర్శిస్తున్నారు. దీనివల్ల జగన్మోహన్ రెడ్డి ప్రజలకు, పార్టీ నేతలకు అందుబాటులో ఉండటం లేదని అభిప్రాయం ఎక్కువగా ప్రచారం అవుతోంది. అన్న బాటలోనే షర్మిల... ఎక్కువగా హైదరాబాద్‌లోనే నివాసంరాజకీయంగా అన్నతో విభేధించి సొంత దారిలో వెళుతున్న షర్మిల నివాసం విషయంలో మాత్రం అన్న బాటలోనే వెళుతోందన్న అభిప్రాయం జనాల్లో ఉంది. నిజానికి ఏపీ కాంగ్రెస్ అధ్యక్షురాలుగా ఉన్న ఆమెకు సొంత పార్టీ నుంచే చాలా విమర్శలు వస్తున్నాయి. పార్టీలో అసమ్మతిని సానుకూలం చేసుకోవాల్సిన అవసరం ఆమెకు ఉంది. తుపాను లాంటి విపత్కర పరిస్థితుల్లో అధికారంలో ఉన్నా లేకపోయినా రాజకీయ పార్టీల అధినేతలు ప్రజలకు నేతలకు అందుబాటులో ఉండాల్సిన అవసరం ఉంది. దానివల్ల క్షేత్రస్థాయిలో పార్టీ నేతలకు ఒక భరోసా ఉండడంతోపాటు సమన్వయంతో పని చేసే అవకాశం ఉంటుంది. కానీ షర్మిల వీలైనంత ఎక్కువగా హైదరాబాదులో ఉండడానికి ప్రాధాన్యత ఇస్తున్నారు. విజయవాడ సమీపంలో ఇల్లు కొన్నారన్న ప్రచారం జరిగినా ఆమె ఇంతవరకు అక్కడకు వెళ్ళింది లేదు. ఆమె కుటుంబ వ్యవహారాల రీత్యా ఎక్కువగా విదేశాల్లో ఉన్న పిల్లల దగ్గరకు వెళుతున్నారు. మరోవైపు వైఎస్ రాజశేఖర్ రెడ్డి వారసుడిగా తన కుమారుడిని ప్రొజెక్ట్ చేసే ప్రయత్నాలూ చేస్తున్నారు. ఇలాంటి కీలక బాధ్యతలు ఎత్తుకున్న షర్మిల తాను ఆంధ్రప్రదేశ్‌లో ఉండాల్సిన అవసరం చాలా ఎక్కువగా ఉంది. కానీ ఎందుకో మరి ఆమె ఇక్కడ నివాసం ఉండడం లేదు. ఇది రాజకీయంగా చాలా రాంగ్ స్ట్రేటజీ అని విశ్లేషకులు చెప్తున్నారు. ప్రచారం లో దూసుకుపోతున్న కూటమిఇలాంటి విషయాల్లో కూటమి చాలా వేగంగా దూసుకుపోతోంది. అది తుపాను అయినా వరదైనా ప్రచారంలో మాత్రం ఏ లోటూ రానీయదు. కొన్నిసార్లు ఈ ప్రచారం ఒక హద్దు దాటిందని, అతివృష్టి చేస్తున్నారని ట్రోల్స్ వస్తున్నా అనుక్షణం ప్రజల దృష్టిలో ఉండడానికి కూటమి ప్రయత్నిస్తోంది. ఈ ప్రచారంతో పోటీ పడడం మాట ఎలా ఉన్నా ముందు సొంత పార్టీ నేతలకు అందుబాటులో ఉండడానికి YS జగన్, షర్మిల లాంటి నేతలు స్థానికంగా ఎక్కువగా ఉండడానికి ప్రాధాన్యత ఇస్తే బాగుంటుందని అనువజ్ణులు చెబుతున్నారు. కమ్యూనిస్టు నేతలు కూడా ఇప్పటికే వరద ప్రాంతాల్లో పర్యటించి వచ్చిన పరిస్థితుల్లో దివంగత ముఖ్యమంత్రి పిల్లలు, రెండు వేరు వేరు పార్టీలకు అధినేతలు ఇలాంటి విషయాల్లో వెనుక పడడం రాంగ్ స్ట్రాటజీ అనే అభిప్రాయం చాలా మందిలో ఉన్న మాట వాస్తవం. మరి ఇప్పటికైనా జగన్, షర్మిల ఆ దిశగా ఆలోచిస్తారేమో చూడాలి.\n",
